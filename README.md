# Hello World DAPP

HWdapp is a hello world decentralized application. Contains the basic functionality so you can use it as a template and start building your own application.

Think of it as a hello world dapp starter kit.

## What the dapp does?

![Screenshot](./docs/HWdapp.png)

- show text stored in the blockchain, and update that text. interact directly with ethereum blockchain!! (a testnet).

- feel free to udpdate the text of my contract through ehterscan.io at RINKEBY -> 0x4E98dfb698055717c013C42e2F84989e9bC9631a

## Technologies stack
> - react - build front end, animations, make your app look cute
> - ethers - Communicate with the blockchain and bridge to frontend
> - hardhat - compile, test and create a local blockchain

## Prerequisites

1. node js and npm
2. metamask account -> [https://metamask.io](url)
3. an alchemy.com account -> [https://www.alchemy.com](url) (only if you want to deploy to testnet)
4. fake ether from the testnet you want to use  -> [https://faucet.rinkeby.io](url) (only if you want to deploy to testnet)

## Installation

1. Clone repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/msucedo/HWdapp.git
``` 

2. Install dependencies
```bash
cd HWdapp/react-zone
npm install
```
and

```bash
cd HWdapp/hardhat-zone
npm install
```

## Usage

- Compile smart contract with hardhat

```bash
cd HWdapp/hardhat-zone
npx hardhat compile
```

- To test on hardhat local network with access to 20 accounts, with 1000eth, 0 blocks mined. note: three open terminal windows needed.
###### 	Terminal window 1 - deploy local blockchain
```bash
cd HWdapp/hardhat-zone
npx hardhat node
```
###### Terminal window 2 - deploy contract to local blockchain
```bash
cd HWdapp/hardhat-zone
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```	
copy the address from the terminal window
1. open HWdapp/react-zone/src/app.js
2. update "contractAddress" with your copied address.
###### Terminal window 3 - deploy server to interact with your application at `http://localhost:3000/`
```bash
cd HWdapp/react-zone
npm start
```	


- To test on a testnet (i.e. rinkeby)
1. edit "HWdapp/hardhat-zone/secret.json"
2. add your alchemy.com api url and your metamask account private key
3. edit "HWdapp/hardhat.zone/hardhat.config.js"
4. remove last comment inside "networks" to enable the testnet settings
3. run below commands
```bash
cd HWdapp/hardhat-zone
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
```	
###### note: copy the contract address from your terminal window, open etherscan.io for the rinkeby network at search for this address. you should be able to see your contract.


## Disclaimer
you might find bugs, but for the simplicity and goal of the exercise they don't represent a risk, take this code as what it is (a path to the needed tools, folders, configurations to build, test and deploy locally a dapp).

Please note the goal of this repository is to give a clearer path of (one in between many choices you have on) how to locally build dapps, I found myself having trouble to understand how to develop locally and now that I have a kinda better idea I wanted to share with anyone interested the tools that I used and make available this simple template.

- note1: these are not the only tools available to build and deploy dapps.
- note2: regarding the alchemy.com account, it is free, from there we just need to create an app and copy the application key
- note3: I did not talk about some steps as they are easily self explanatory (funding your metamask with fake ether, create an alchemy account, etc)
- note4: any questions, comments, suggestions feel free to ping me at discord @msaucedo#2231


## FAQ

- I'm having issues compiling and running the project, what should I do?
> I'd encourage you to go try solve the issue by yourself, if no luck ping me @msaucedo#2231 at discord.

- I deployed my contract to my locahost network using hardhat but after updating my contract I don't see the changes
> everytime you make a change to your contract, you need to deploy it again.

- I ran "npm start" but I can't deploy my contract
> 1. make sure you are running your localhost node with hardhat
> 2. deploy your smart contract to your localhost network
> 3. run your frontend with "npm start"
